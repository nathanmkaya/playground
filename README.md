# Playground

## What is this?

This is a collection on of all my experiments. I want to have a Github activity streak that spans
a whole year. This is just an exercise of discipline in commiting everyday and consistency.

## What would be the Content?

I'm not sure yet what the content will be but for sure it will be all software develoment related.
I'm a bit of fad junkie and tend to hop onto the newest thing in the industry. I also tend to get easily
distracted, with my varied interest. I hope to be consistent in what I do to see a new talk or lesson to completion.

You could say that this is my version of 100 days of code but with a target of 365 days of activity.

## Structure

Just to put the cart before the horse. I don't have any structure in mind apart from having folders that cannot
have their onw repo in here while I add submodules to other repos I'm working on.


## TODO

- Improve this readme
- Add more content and explainations to the repo
- etc.
